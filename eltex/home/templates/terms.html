Disputes (Resolutions) Policy
Overview
Generally, transactions are conducted smoothly on Eltex. However there may be some cases where both the Buyers and Sellers may face issues. At Eltex, we have a Dispute Resolution process in order to resolve disputes between Buyers and Sellers.
What is a 'dispute'?
A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer and a Seller in connection with a transaction on the Platform.
How does a 'dispute' occur in the Marketplace?
Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and the Seller. Disputes arise out of an issue that is raised by either party not being completely satisfied with the resolution of their complaint/issue.
It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they should attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a dispute, the Seller's payment for that order is put on hold immediately until the issue is resolved.
How is a 'dispute' created?
Whenever there is a disagreement, the Buyer can write to dispute@Eltex.com, while the Seller can write to ss@Eltex.com, in order to raise a dispute. Disputes can be raised at a particular transaction level.
What are the various types of 'disputes'?
Following are the indicative examples of potential disputes:
1.	Wrong item received
2.	Item Not as described
3.	Damaged or Seal broken on Product
4.	Part/Accessory missing
5.	Item not Compatible
6.	Seller Description/Specification Wrong
7.	Defective (Functional issues)
8.	Product not working and Manufacturer claims invalid Invoice
In case the Seller rejects the return request of the Buyer, and Buyer raises a dispute, then Eltex will try to mediate and resolve the dispute between both the parties. If the dispute is resolved in favour of the Buyer, a refund is provided once the product is returned to the Seller. If the dispute is settled in favour of the Seller, Buyer is entitled to any refund.
Buyer Protection Program

Eltex Infringement Verification (FIV) - Reporting Listing Violations
Eltex has put in place Eltex Infringement Verification process so that intellectual property owners could easily report listings that infringe their rights. It is in Eltex's interest to ensure that infringing products are removed from the site, as they erode Buyer and good Seller trust.
•	If you are a Verified Rights Owner and want to report a listing issue, see Eltex's FIV. Note: Only the intellectual property rights owner can report potentially infringing products or listings through FIV. If you are not the intellectual property rights owner, you can still help by getting in touch with the rights owner and encouraging them to [contact us][].
•	If your listing was removed through FIV, and you believe that your listing was removed in error, please [contact us][].
Eltex does not and cannot verify that Sellers have the right or ability to sell or distribute their listed products. However, Eltex is committed to removing infringing or unlicensed products once an authorized representative of the rights owner properly reports them to Eltex.
FIV works to ensure that item listings do not infringe upon the copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. FIV participants have the ability to identify and request removal of allegedly infringing products and materials.
Any person or company who holds intellectual property rights (such as a copyright, trademark or patent) which may be infringed upon by products listed on Eltex is encouraged to become a FIV member.
Program membership entitles you (Verified Rights Owner) to the following benefits:
•	Rapid response by Eltex in ending listings reported by you (as the Verified Rights Owner) as allegedly infringing
•	Dedicated priority email queues for reporting alleged infringements
•	The ability to obtain identifying information about Eltex's users'
How to Become a FIV Member

The information requested by the Notice of Infringement is designed to ensure that parties reporting products are authorized by the rights owners, and to enable Eltex to easily identify the material or listing to be ended.
In the interest of keeping the process easy and simple, after we receive your first Notice of Infringement in hard copy, future notices can be sent to Us by email at ss@Eltex.com.
